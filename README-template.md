## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main aim of this project was to get an introduction to Frontend Mentor. I focused on setting up and utilizing github with VS Code, building out a pre-designed project, and getting comfortable with Frontend Mentor's workflow. While the project itself is very simple, it did offer a short and sweet opportunity to practice flexbox and CSS positioning properties. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to continue to hone my skills with flexbox and other positioning properties in CSS.
