## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main aim of this project was to get an introduction to Frontend Mentor. I focused on setting up and utilizing GitHub with VS Code, building out a pre-designed project, and getting comfortable with Frontend Mentor's workflow. While the project itself is very simple, it did offer a short and sweet opportunity to practice flexbox and CSS positioning properties. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to continue to hone my skills with flexbox and other positioning properties in CSS.
